#+TITLE: crypto-scanner tasks
* DONE Rename files & reformat styles
Use prettier default settings to reformat files
* DONE Rp
* DONE Refactor graph service
* DONE rework tests as typescrip
* DONE update comments
once we relax edges n-1 times, there shouold be no changes for consquitive relaxations
if we relax one more time && distance updates, that means we have a negative cycle
once we know we have a negative cycle, we can plot & calculate the path
* DONE iterating over edges duplicates the calls
- BTCETH
  BTCETH
  ETHBTC
  ETHBTC

  answer: this is because we craete 2 edges per pair
  : bid edge
  : ask edge
* DONE RESEARCH: article about arbitrage & why we need to use negative & log values of exchange rates
https://reasonabledeviations.com/2019/03/02/currency-arbitrage-graphs/

: TLDR
BellmanFord works by ADDING weights, which doesn't apply to exchange rates
Why?
Exchange rates have to be multiplied
Example:
BTCETH has rates  0.03/0.025
if we have one ETH and convert it to BTC, we will get
1 * 0.03 = 0.03
when we convert back
0.025/0.03 = 0.83333
(we just lost money)

** if we take a natural log of rates, addition will be the same as multiplication of original values
ln = log e (natural log)

Example:
ln(0.03) = −3.506557897
ln(0.025) = −3.688879454
sum = -7.1955
e^-7.1955 = 0.000749953
0.03*0.025 = 0.00075
close enough!

** we multiply ln values by -1, because BF algo looks for shortest path
In arbitrage we look to end up with MORE than we started with
BF algo looks for the SHORTEST path ie. the lowest value
If we invert edge values, we can use BF and end up finding the same thing!

* DONE updated tasks and how to implement algorithm
* DONE #graph-service implement correct edge direction
Exmple for BTCETH
Asks BTC->ETH
Bids BTC<-ETH
* DONE #graph-service calculate-edge-weight-as-negative-natural-log
ASKS have to be divided by 1/ask & then ln * (-1)
BIDS ln * (-1)
* TODO #graph-service remove-root-node-from-graph-service

: TLDR
we don't need a root node, just pick any node & set it's distance to 0 ( this will be our source node )

* TODO #graph-service filter out less then best rates when creating edge between two nodes
Asks -> lower is best
Bids -> highest is best

* TODO #edgeValues remove-ask-bid-information-from-weight
it is irrelevant, direction of the edges is easier way to handle weight
remove all logic associated with bid/ask - its convoluted and unnecessary
